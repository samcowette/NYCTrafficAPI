# NYC Traffic Volume Predictor API ðŸš¦

This is a Flask-based API that uses a trained machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to predict traffic volume on New York City streets based on the day of the week, hour, borough, and street.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The model was trained on 2024 NYC traffic volume data using the following features:
- `weekday` (e.g. "Tuesday")
- `hour` (0â€“23)
- `boro` (e.g. "Brooklyn")
- `street` (e.g. "FDR Drive")

All input values are mapped to numeric values that were used during model training.
